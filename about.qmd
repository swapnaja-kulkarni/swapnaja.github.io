Hi! I am Swapnaja, a current student @ George Mason.
In terms of courses,I am  enrolled in STAT-515,CS-504,and AIT-580.After working for a few years as a Market Research Analyst, I was intrigued with the field of Decision Sciences and Analytics. My goal is to learn and get hands-on experience in Big Data to build a strong Data Science background. Through this course, I intend to learn data analysis using R, Python, and various visualization tools.
